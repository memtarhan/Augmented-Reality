## Physics on Virtual Objects

> You can define how a virtual object interacts with others(static, dynamic, or kinematic), the shape of a virtual object such as a box or sphere, and the force applied to a virtual object. 

A virtual object can behave on one of three ways: 

* **Static - ** Cannot move and is unaffected by collision or force
* **Dynamic - **Affected by forces and collisions. 
* **Kinematic - **Not affected by forces or collisions, but can affect dynamic virtual objects. 
  * In a video game a road can be example of kinematics.
